Continually observing DeltaV map...
Running out of memory...
Your computer will self destruct in 10... 9...
Igniting oceans...
Classifying information...
Counting stars...
Abandoning space technology...
Observing rings...
Rolling down hills...
Tabbing out of the game instead of reading these...
Wondering why KSC is on a mountain...
Initialising pessimism...
Running out of loading tip ideas...
Tabbing through all 43 planets...
